# DaVinci Resolve MCP Server Features

This document tracks the implementation status of features in the DaVinci Resolve MCP (Multi-Client Protocol) Server. It is organized by feature categories and provides details on implementation status, compatibility with clients, and any known issues.

## Implementation Status

The MCP server implements nearly all features from the DaVinci Resolve scripting API, but our testing has revealed that while we have implemented 202 features (100%), only a small percentage have been verified working on macOS (8%), with many features still needing verification (82%) or having known issues (10%).

Testing has primarily been conducted on macOS, with Windows support implemented but requiring thorough testing. Each feature in this document is marked with symbols indicating its current status:

**Status Key:**
- ✅ - Implemented and verified working
- ⚠️ - Implemented but needs testing/verification
- 🐞 - Implemented but has known issues
- 🟡 - Planned feature
- 🚫 - Not implemented/supported

The compatibility columns indicate whether a feature is known to work with specific clients (Cursor/Claude) on specific platforms (Mac/Windows).

## Feature Categories

## Status Definitions

✅ - **Implemented & Verified**: Feature is fully implemented and verified working  
⚠️ - **Implemented with Limitations**: Feature works but has known limitations or requirements  
🔄 - **In progress**: Feature is in development or testing phase  
🟡 - **Planned**: Feature is planned but not yet implemented  
❌ - **Not implemented**: Feature will not be implemented  
🚫 - **Not applicable**: Feature is not applicable to the current platform  
🐞 - **Implementation Issues**: Feature is implemented but has known bugs  

## Client/Platform Compatibility Update

## Testing Summary

During our testing process, we've identified several key issues and limitations:

1. **Color Page Operations**: Several color-related operations failed with "Cannot access grade object" errors, including AddNode and SetColorWheelPrimaryParam. These issues may be related to the current project state or clip selection.

2. **Delivery Operations**: Adding render jobs to the queue consistently failed in our tests, though clearing the render queue works correctly.

3. **Media Pool Operations**: Some operations such as creating new bins and timelines failed when existing items with the same name were present, indicating a need for better error handling or checking.

4. **Proxy and Transcription**: Proxy and transcription operations failed with various issues, including "Clip not found" errors, suggesting the need for better media management integration.

5. **Project Settings**: Setting project settings failed with parameter type issues, suggesting a mismatch between the expected and provided parameter formats.

### Next Steps

Based on our testing, we recommend:

1. Implementing better error handling and validation in the API endpoints
2. Adding more robust logging for troubleshooting
3. Creating comprehensive test cases for each feature category
4. Focusing on fixing the most critical issues in color grading and rendering first
5. Adding better documentation for parameter types and expected formats

The MCP server has good fundamental implementation but requires significant testing and debugging to reach production readiness.
